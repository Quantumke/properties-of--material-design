##What is material design
Material Design (codenamed Quantum Paper) is a design language developed by Google. Expanding upon the "card" motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.
###Who can use MAterial design
Material Design can be used in Android version 2.1 and up via the v7 appcompat library, which is used on virtually all Android devices that were made after 2009. Material Design will gradually be extended throughout Google's array of web and mobile products, providing a consistent experience across all platforms and applications. Google has also released application programming interfaces (APIs) for third-party developers to incorporate the design language into their applications
###Scope of Material design
MDL makes it easy to add a material design look and feel to your websites. The “Lite” part of MDL comes from several key design goals: MDL has few dependencies, making it easy to install and use. It is framework-agnostic, meaning MDL can be used with any of the rapidly changing landscape of front-end tool chains. MDL has a low overhead in terms of code size
###principes of material design
Material design is guided by print-based design elements—such as typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery—to create hierarchy, meaning, and focus that immerse the user in the experience. Material design adopts tools from the field of print design, like baseline grids and structural templates, encouraging consistency across environments by repeating visual elements, structural grids, and spacing across platforms and screen sizes. These layouts scale to fit any screen size, which simplifies the process of creating scalable apps. 
 ###  How paper works

In material design, the physical properties of paper are translated to the screen. The background of an application resembles the flat, opaque texture of a sheet of paper.

An application’s behavior mimics the paper’s ability to be re-sized, shuffled, and bound together in multiple sheets. Elements that live outside of applications, such as status or system bars, receive a different treatment. They are separate from the app content beneath them, and do not carry the physical properties of paper.

### Floating action button


A floating action button is a circular sheet separate from a toolbar. It represents a single promoted action.

It can straddle a step if it relates to the content creating that step.
##The 9 principles
###    Material is the metaphor

A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. Our material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by our study of paper and ink, yet open to imagination and magic.
 ###        Surfaces are intuitive and natural

Surfaces and edges provide visual cues that are grounded in our experience of reality. The use of familiar tactile attributes speaks to primal parts of our brains and helps us quickly understand affordances.
